# 🛸 Just Notes (or... Just Note-taLking)

Welcome to **Just Notes**, the collaborative note-taking app that's so simple, it actually encourages you to talk less and write more (or just "note-taLking" as we like to call it around here).

Developed with 💜 and a massive amount of pastel colors.

## ✨ Features that'll make you go "Ooh"

- **🎨 High-Stakes Aesthetics:** Every note, folder, and comment is assigned a scientifically-calibrated pastel color. It's like a bowl of Lucky Charms, but for your productivity.
- **👾 Developer Chic:** Styled with *JetBrains Mono* because if your notes don't look like code, are they even notes?
- **🤝 Any-Number-of-Users Ready:** Thanks to our high-tech Supabase upgrade, you can collaborate with your friends, your cat, or that one imaginary coworker who actually gets things done.
- **🌓 Dark Mode:** For when the notes are bright but your soul is nocturnal.
- **🚀 Cloud Native-ish:** Powered by **Supabase** (because we graduated from the Google Drive "Origin Not Allowed" struggle group).

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack (The "How it's made" part)

- **Frontend:** React + Vite + Tailwind CSS (The holy trinity).
- **Backend:** Supabase (Our savior from OAuth hell).
- **Auth:** Google OAuth (Because remembering passwords is for people in 2005).
- **Styling:** Vanilla CSS + Lucide Icons (Keeping it sleek).

## 🚀 Get Running (For the brave)

1. **Clone it:** `git clone https://github.com/nandanadileep/fluffy-waffle.git`
2. **Setup your `.env`:**
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-extra-long-secret-key
   ```
3. **Install the fun:** `npm install`
4. **Ignite:** `npm run dev`

## ⚠️ Important Note-taLking Rules

1. Typos are not mistakes; they are "intentional creative choices."
2. If the pastel color doesn't match your mood, keep refreshing. The universe will eventually provide.
3. Dark mode is mandatory after 9 PM. We have a reputation to uphold.
